# Sentiment Analysis and Logistic Regression Model

This project performs sentiment analysis on a Amazon review dataset to see how to extract sentiment from text data and then implements a Logistic Regression model to see if we can predict a user's star rating from their text review. I optimized the hyperparameters and compared it to support vector machines to see how the performance between the two models compares.

We will use a publicly available dataset of reviews of women's dresses from Amazon, available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/amazon-reviews-on-women-dresses?resource=download).

The dataset has also been uploaded as a csv file ("WomensDressReviews.csv") for convenience.

The implementation of the model can be found in the .py file ("Sentiment_Analysis_Logistic_Regression.py") along with explanations of the theory.
