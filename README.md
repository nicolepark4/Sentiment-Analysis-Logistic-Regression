# Sentiment Analysis and Logistic Regression Model

This project performs sentiment analysis on a Amazon review dataset to see how to extract sentiment from text data, and then to implement a Logistic Regression model to see if we could predict a user's star rating from their text review. I optimized the hyperparameters and compared it to support vector machines to see how the performance between the two models compares.

We will use the Dermatology dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/amazon-reviews-on-women-dresses?resource=download).

The dataset has also been uploaded as a csv file ("WomensDressReviews.csv") for convenience.

The implementation of the model can be found in the ipynb file ("NicoleParkMath156ExtraCredit.ipynb") along with explanations of the theory.
