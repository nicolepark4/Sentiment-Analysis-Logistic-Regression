I decided to implement my sentiment analysis on a Amazon review dataset to see how to extract sentiment from text data, and then to implement a Logistic Regression model to see if we could predict a user's star rating from their text review. I optimized the hyperparameters and compared it to support vector machines to see how the performance between the two models compares. Overall, this assignemnt combined a lot of concepts from class into a real-life dataset.

We will use the Dermatology dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/amazon-reviews-on-women-dresses?resource=download).

The dataset has also been uploaded as a csv file ("WomensDressReviews.csv") for convenience.

The implementation of the model can be found in the ipynb file ("NicoleParkMath156ExtraCredit.ipynb") along with explanations of the theory.
